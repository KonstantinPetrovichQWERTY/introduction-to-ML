# Lab 4: Classifiers and Regularization Concepts

## Objectives
1. Understand and apply **Lasso** and **Ridge** regression.
2. Explore the **Naïve Bayes** classifier.
3. Implement and analyze the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier.
4. Evaluate models using **cross-validation** techniques.

   - Used for demonstrating Lasso and Ridge regression.
   - Focuses on predicting housing prices in Boston suburbs.
2. **Iris Dataset**:
   - Used for classification tasks with Naïve Bayes and KNN.
   - Contains 3 flower classes with 4 feature dimensions.
