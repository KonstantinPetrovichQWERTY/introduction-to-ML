# Lab 3: Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent

## Objectives
1. Compare classification problems to regression problems.
2. Understand and implement the **sigmoid function** and **loss function**.
3. Perform **data preprocessing** and **manual feature selection**.
4. Train and evaluate a **logistic regression model** using **sklearn**.
5. Analyze model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
6. Explore logistic regression's strengths, weaknesses, and its gradient descent optimization.
